## What is StealthLink?
StealthLink is an an advanced anti-forensic tool that is designed to exploit network protocols for covert communication. It leverages a hybrid approach by using HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP and DNS protocols as covert channels to send and receive secret payloads. This tool contains features like protocol adaptation, which allows the option to select the optimal protocol based on the network environment, and dummy traffic generation, ensuring the payloads are concealed within normal network behaviour.
